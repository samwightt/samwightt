### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam. I'm a CS student at the University of Alabama, and a React, Rails, Javascript/Typescript, and Rust developer.

# What I'm working on

Here's what I'm working on now, in order of priority:

- [Chorale](https://github.com/samwightt/chorale), a blazing-fast Notion renderer that's almost twice as fast as any alternative.
- [Wont](https://wont.app/), a new take on habit tracking.
- [Ibis](https://github.com/samwightt/ibis), a documentation package manager.

# Where I'm at online

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samwightt) - Stream of consciousness, developer-friendly goodness
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/samwightt) - I use this every so often, not on there that much.
- [My website](https://samw.dev/) - I have a blog I'm working on growing there.
