### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam. I'm a CS student at the University of Alabama, and a React, Rails, Javascript/Typescript, and Rust developer.

# What I'm working on

Here's what I'm working on now, in order of priority:

- [Chorale](https://github.com/samwightt/chorale), a blazing-fast Notion renderer that's almost twice as fast as any alternative.
- [Wont](https://wont.app/), a new take on habit tracking.
- [Ibis](https://github.com/samwightt/ibis), a documentation package manager.

# What I've Done

## **[Blueprint at UA](https://blueprintatua.org/)** *(Founder and President)*: September 2019 - Present

Blueprint at UA is a student organization at The University of Alabama that creates open-source software for nonprofits. I founded the organization in September of 2019 and currently serve as president, serving on the exec team to oversee the direction of the organization. our exec team oversees and assists our developments teams, plans events for our members, and works with our nonprofit partners to make sure their needs are being met.

I founded Blueprint at UA because I saw two large problems. First, I observed that smaller nonprofits had a desperate need for software development services but often didn't have the funds to pay for those services. Second, I saw that CS students at UA struggled to find opportunities on-campus that could help them grow as a developer. I noticed that these two needs could fix each other, and worked to found Blueprint at UA, a student organization whose goal is to fix both of these problems.

## **Nucor** *(Level II Engineering Co-Op)*: May 2020 - August 2020

I worked as a co-op for Nucor, a steel company, using software engineering to improve manufacturing processes. I developed the first version of an algorithm for checking for manufacturing errors using plant sensor data. I also improved efficacy of internal file-syncing software, drastically reducing memory usage by 97%. I worked heavily with Transact-SQL, C#, and frontend Javascript frameworks to design fast, efficient dashboards for plant operators.
