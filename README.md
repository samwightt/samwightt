Hi there! I'm a full stack software engineer using my expertise in web performance, SEO, and A11Y to craft applications users rave about. I'm an experienced remote worker who loves collaborating with diverse, cross-functional teams and building a learning-oriented culture.

I've worked in companies in a variety of industries: a boutique web design agency, a government procurement startup, and even a steel mill. My rich experience enables me to collaborate with product, design, and business stakeholders and effortlessly translate their needs into software that produces value.
